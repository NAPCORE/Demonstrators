Since Clearing House and Self Description components are external components, there is currently no ways to get systematic approval from these components. The community is working on a toggle to disable the calls to these components. Currently, there is a workaround to bypass these checks using the SQL queries to be executed in the backend database (See below section Technical Steps to bypass external components).

If all checks are passed and registration is approved, the company admin will be notified via email


See [technical steps](./04_Technical_Steps.md) to bypass external components
